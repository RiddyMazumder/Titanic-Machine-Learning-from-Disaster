![Titanic Banner](https://github.com/RiddyMazumder/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster/blob/main/TITANIC-Explained-Hymn-to-the-Sea-1.webp)

**🧑‍💻 PREDICTING PASSENGER SURVIVAL ON THE TITANIC USING MACHINE LEARNING**

**⚓ THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON THE CLASSIC KAGGLE TITANIC: MACHINE LEARNING FROM DISASTER CHALLENGE. THE GOAL IS TO BUILD A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT DETERMINES WHETHER A PASSENGER SURVIVED THE TITANIC SHIPWRECK BASED ON AVAILABLE FEATURES SUCH AS AGE, GENDER, CLASS, AND FARE. 🚢**
